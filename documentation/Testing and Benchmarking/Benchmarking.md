# Benchmarking 

Included in the `./tests` directory is a file `benchmark.cc` which can be used to time the code uses 
google's GoogleBenchmark framework(https://github.com/google/benchmark). The docs give you flags which you 
can pass to the `./bin/speedTest` executable which runs the benchmark code in `benchmark.cc`.
