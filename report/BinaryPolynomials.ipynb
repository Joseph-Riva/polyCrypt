    "# Binary Polynomials\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project was to create a relatively efficient, and easy to use, implementation of binary polynomials over finite fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Finite Field?\n",
    "a Finite Field is a set of elements with finite cardinality(a finite number of elements) and the operations of addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example, \n",
    "The Integers, $Z$, over a prime number, $p$, give the finite field $Z_p$ which contains the elements $\\{0,...,p-1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The general arithmetic in $Z_p$ is generally pretty straight-forward:\n",
    "#### Addition\n",
    "$1+12\\equiv 6\\:mod\\:7$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiplication and Division\n",
    "$4*6=24 \\equiv 3\\:mod\\:7$\n",
    "\n",
    "$4/3 = 4*inverse(3) = 4*5 \\equiv 6\\:mod\\:7$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note about Inverses\n",
    "An inverse in $Z_p$ for an element, $x$, is defined as the element,$x^{-1}$, where $x*x^{-1}\\equiv 1\\:mod\\:p$"

    "## Extension Fields\n",
    "From the ideas we see above in $Z_p$ we get extension fields. One important one is extension fields of $Z_{2^q}$ especially over the polynomials. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From $Z_p$ to $Z_{2^q}$\n",
    "In $Z_p$ we used a prime modulus to create a finite field, but in the polynomials we need an analogue: an irreducible polynomial or one which can't be factored and is of degree $q$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding these irreducible polynomials is a relatively hard, but mostly solved problem. So, I simply created a table of some common ones to be used here. A good table of these can be found here: https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/98/HPL-98-135.pdf"
